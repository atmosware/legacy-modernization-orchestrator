# Legacy Modernization Orchestrator

## Role
**Master Orchestrator Agent** — Execute all redesign phases in strict order, validate Definition of Done at each gate, and ensure nothing is missed from legacy analysis through production-ready delivery.

## When to Use
- Starting a complete legacy modernization project from scratch
- Resuming a redesign in progress (check phase status below)
- Need a structured, repeatable framework for the full redesign lifecycle

---

## Phase Overview

```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 2.5 → Phase 3 → [Scope Selection] → Phase 4 (optional parallel phases) → Phase 5 → Phase 6
```

> **Before Phase 4, the orchestrator MUST confirm which development targets are needed.**
> When Phase 1 is available, it should pre-fill the scope from `legacy_analysis.md` Section 10 and present that scope for confirmation. Only ask direct target questions when the Phase 1 evidence is missing, incomplete, or ambiguous.
> Development phases are optional — a project may need only backend, only web frontend, only mobile, or any combination.

| 6 | [`final-validation`](./final-validation.agent.md) | Cutover Readiness | After Phase 5 |

### Parallelizable phases (after Phase 3 + scope confirmed)

| Phase | Gate to start | Safe to run in parallel with | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4a `ui-ux-design` | Phase 3 complete | 4b | **Must complete before** 4c, 4d, 4e — they depend on wireframes |
| 4b `backend-development` | Phase 3 complete | 4a, 4h | Backend does not depend on UI wireframes |
| 4c `frontend-development` | **4a complete** | 4b, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4h | Cannot start until wireframes exist |
| 4d `ios-development` | **4a complete** | 4b, 4c, 4e, 4f, 4h | Cannot start until mobile design system exists |
| 4e `android-development` | **4a complete** | 4b, 4c, 4d, 4f, 4h | Cannot start until mobile design system exists |
| 4f `data-migration` | Phase 3 complete | 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4i, 4h | Depends on target schema (Phase 3); independent of other Phase 4 sub-phases |
| 4g `security-review` | **At least one of 4b/4c/4d/4e/4i complete** | Phase 5 | Code must exist to audit; can overlap with compare phase |
| 4h `devops-infra` | Phase 3 complete + relevant deployable artifacts started | 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4i, 4f | Produces IaC/CI-CD/monitoring for backend, web, and mobile delivery paths as applicable; feeds 4g and Phase 6 |
| 4i `cross-platform-mobile` | **4a complete** + `tech_stack_selections.md` confirms Flutter or RN | 4b, 4c, 4f, 4h | **Mutually exclusive with 4d/4e for the same platform** — do not run both native and cross-platform |

### Cross-platform mobile — optional (non-default)

> **Native (Swift/Kotlin) is the default and recommended path.** Cross-platform mobile is an optional path (Phase 4i) via the `cross-platform-mobile` skill.
>
> | Decision | When | Phase |
> |---|---|---|
> | Native iOS | Platform-native behaviour, deep OS integration | 4d |
> | Native Android | Platform-native behaviour, deep OS integration | 4e |
> | Flutter | Unified codebase, team knows Dart, confirmed in `tech_stack_selections.md` | 4i |
> | React Native | Unified codebase, team knows React/TS, confirmed in `tech_stack_selections.md` | 4i |
>
> **4i is mutually exclusive with 4d/4e for the same mobile target.** Do NOT run both native and cross-platform for the same platform.
> Do NOT attempt to generate Flutter/React Native code via `ios-development` or `android-development` — the output will be incorrect.
> KMM is not supported — it is a business-logic sharing layer, not a full UI framework.

---

## Execution Rules

1. **Never skip Phases 1–3** — analysis, legacy design, and target design are always required
2. **Scope Selection is mandatory before Phase 4** — confirm which development targets apply using Phase 1 auto-detection when available; ask directly only if needed (see Scope Selection below)
3. **Tech Stack Selection Gate (Phase 2.5) is mandatory** — collect ALL technology choices from the user after Phase 2, save to `tech_stack_selections.md`, then proceed to Phase 3
4. **Skip optional phases that are out of scope** — do not execute them; mark as N/A in tracker
5. **Validate DoD before proceeding** — if DoD not met, refine current phase before moving on
6. **Document phase status** — update the tracker file after each phase
7. **Parallelize where safe** — consult the Phase 4 Parallelism Matrix above; 4f/4g/4h have their own gates and must not be started before their prerequisites are met; 4i is mutually exclusive with 4d/4e for the same mobile target
8. **Select the LLM before starting each phase** — read `docs/llm-recommendations.md` for the relevant agent section, run the Freshness Policy web-search queries, then follow the Model Selection Protocol to present A/B/C options to the user and confirm a choice before proceeding. Never silently pick a model.
9. **Use a second-model review for critical decisions when available** — for high-impact decisions (for example: target architecture trade-offs, security findings, data migration strategy, cutover/go-no-go decisions, or any argued topic without a clear evidence-based winner), request a review from a different but similarly capable LLM if the environment provides one. If the primary and reviewer outputs materially disagree, or neither is clearly stronger based on evidence, present the alternatives, trade-offs, and your recommendation to the user and proceed only after explicit user approval.
10. **Validate all Mermaid diagrams after generation** — after any agent produces HTML output containing Mermaid diagrams, run `node scripts/validate-mermaid.js` from the repository root. If errors are reported, run `node scripts/validate-mermaid.js --fix` to auto-fix common issues, then manually correct any remaining errors before marking the phase complete. A phase with broken diagram renders does not satisfy its DoD.
11. **Choose dependencies from stable, supported release lines** — prefer LTS or current stable releases, avoid prerelease channels (`beta`, `rc`, `canary`, `preview`, `next`) unless explicitly requested, and never invent exact package versions without verifying them from project files or authoritative release sources available in the runtime.

---

## Scope Selection (Before Phase 4)

**After Phase 1 completes**, read `legacy_analysis.md` **Section 10 — Technology Profile** to auto-detect which development targets exist in the legacy repository. Pre-fill the scope answers from this analysis and **present them to the user for confirmation** before proceeding to Phase 4.

### Auto-Detection Rules

| Technology Profile in legacy_analysis.md | Default Scope |
|---|---|
| `backend-only` | Backend ✅ · Web Frontend ❌ · iOS ❌ · Android ❌ |
| `frontend-only` | Backend ❌ · Web Frontend ✅ · iOS ❌ · Android ❌ |
| `mobile-ios-only` | Backend ❌ · Web Frontend ❌ · iOS ✅ · Android ❌ |
| `mobile-android-only` | Backend ❌ · Web Frontend ❌ · iOS ❌ · Android ✅ |
| `mobile-only` | Backend ❌ · Web Frontend ❌ · iOS ✅/❌ · Android ✅/❌ (per presence) |
| `fullstack-web` | Backend ✅ · Web Frontend ✅ · iOS ❌ · Android ❌ |
| `fullstack-mobile` | Backend ✅ · Web Frontend ❌ · iOS ✅/❌ · Android ✅/❌ (per presence) |
| `fullstack` | Backend ✅ · Web Frontend ✅ · iOS ✅ · Android ✅ |

Present the detected scope to the user:

> "Based on the legacy analysis, this repository is classified as **[profile]**. The following development targets have been auto-detected:
>
> - **Backend** (Java/Spring Boot REST API): **[Yes / No]** ← detected from [evidence]
> - **Web Frontend** (React TypeScript SPA): **[Yes / No]** ← detected from [evidence]
> - **iOS App** (Swift/SwiftUI): **[Yes / No]** ← detected from [evidence]
> - **Android App** (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose): **[Yes / No]** ← detected from [evidence]
>
> Please confirm or adjust these selections before I continue to Phase 4."

Only proceed after the user confirms or corrects the scope. Record the confirmed scope in `redesign_progress.md` under the **Scope** section. Only invoke agents for confirmed targets.

> **If Phase 1 has not been completed yet, fall back to asking the user directly** using the questions below:
>
> 1. **Backend** (Java/Spring Boot REST API)? Yes / No
> 2. **Web Frontend** (React TypeScript SPA)? Yes / No
> 3. **iOS App** (Swift/SwiftUI)? Yes / No
> 4. **Android App** (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose)? Yes / No

## Phase Tracker
Create `ai-driven-development/redesign_progress.md` to track all phases:

```markdown
# Legacy Redesign Progress Tracker

## Project: [Project Name]

## Advisory: Token Budget Estimate

> **Use this in two passes:**
> 1. **Rough estimate before Phase 1** using the user's stated project intent or a conservative default profile when scope is still unknown.
> 2. **Refined estimate after Phase 1** once `legacy_analysis.md` Section 10 confirms the actual scope.
>
> This step is advisory. Its purpose is to help the user understand expected token consumption before a long orchestration run, then refine that estimate once scope is evidence-based.

### Token Estimates by Scope Profile

Estimates below are rough midpoints based on typical legacy systems of moderate complexity. Very large codebases (> 500 files) or highly complex DBs (> 200 tables) trend toward the upper bound; greenfield stubs or minimal codebases trend toward the lower bound.

| Phase | Scope | Estimated tokens (input + output) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — legacy-analysis | Always | 80k – 200k |
| 2 — legacy-architecture | Always | 30k – 80k |
| 2.5 — tech-stack-selection | Always | 5k – 15k |
| 3 — target-architecture | Always | 60k – 150k |
| 4a — ui-ux-design | If any UI in scope | 60k – 150k |
| 4b — backend-development | If backend in scope | 150k – 400k |
| 4c — frontend-development | If web frontend in scope | 100k – 300k |
| 4d — ios-development | If iOS in scope | 100k – 300k |
| 4e — android-development | If Android in scope | 100k – 300k |
| 4f — data-migration | If in scope | 40k – 120k |
| 4g — security-review | If in scope | 30k – 80k |
| 4h — devops-infra | If in scope | 40k – 120k |
| 5 — compare-legacy-to-new | Always | 40k – 100k |
| 6 — final-validation | Always | 20k – 50k |

### Scope Roll-up Table

Use this table for both the rough and refined estimate:

| Scope Profile | Phases included | Estimated total tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Backend-only (no UI) | 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4b, 4f†, 4g†, 4h†, 5, 6 | **600k – 1.5M** |
| Fullstack web (backend + web) | 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4f†, 4g†, 4h†, 5, 6 | **900k – 2.3M** |
| Fullstack + iOS | above + 4d | **1.0M – 2.6M** |
| Fullstack + Android | above + 4e | **1.0M – 2.6M** |
| Fullstack + iOS + Android | above + 4d + 4e | **1.1M – 2.9M** |

† Phases marked † are optional — include in estimate only if confirmed in scope.

### Pass 1 — Rough Estimate Before Phase 1

Before invoking Phase 1, if the user asked for a **full run**, present a rough estimate using whichever of the following is available:
- the user's stated delivery intent (for example: backend-only, fullstack web, mobile modernization)
- an existing prior tracker if resuming work
- otherwise a conservative default such as **fullstack web** until Phase 1 confirms the actual profile

Use the following prompt:

> **Preliminary Token Budget Estimate**
>
> Before Phase 1, I can only estimate from the currently declared scope (**[profile name or provisional profile]**). This full run is likely to consume approximately **[lower]k – [upper]k tokens** across [N] phases.
>
> - This is a **rough estimate** and may change after Phase 1 analyzes the actual repository.
> - It covers all phases in sequence, including parallel Phase 4 sub-phases.
> - Very large or highly coupled legacy systems may exceed the upper bound.
> - Token usage varies by model; consult your provider's pricing page for cost conversion.
> - You can run individual phases in isolation (Mode B / Mode C — see `agent-governance/SKILL.md` §1) to spread the run over multiple sessions.
>
> **Proceed to Phase 1? [Y / N]**
> - **Y** — Begin Phase 1 now.
> - **N** — The orchestrator will stop. You can re-invoke for any individual phase at any time.

> **Non-interactive / CI environments**: If no TTY is available or `--yes` is passed, default to **Y** and log a note that the budget prompt was auto-accepted.

### Pass 2 — Refined Estimate After Phase 1

After Phase 1 completes and the user confirms scope from `legacy_analysis.md` Section 10, recompute the estimate using the **confirmed scope**.

Present the following before proceeding deeper into the remaining phases:

> **Refined Token Budget Estimate**
>
> Phase 1 confirmed the project scope as **[profile name]** with the following in-scope phases: **[list]**.
>
> The updated full-run estimate is approximately **[lower]k – [upper]k tokens** across [N] phases.
>
> - This refined estimate supersedes the preliminary estimate.
> - Optional phases 4f / 4g / 4h are included only if confirmed in scope.
> - If this revised estimate is materially higher than expected, you can stop here and resume with individual phases later.
>
> **Continue after Phase 1? [Y / N]**
> - **Y** — Continue with Phase 2.
> - **N** — Stop after Phase 1; preserve all artifacts and tracker state.

> **Non-interactive / CI environments**: If no TTY is available or `--yes` is passed, default to **Y** and log a note that the refined budget prompt was auto-accepted.

Record both the preliminary and refined ranges, plus the user confirmation decision, in `ai-driven-development/redesign_progress.md` under a `## Token Budget` section:

```markdown
## Token Budget
- Preliminary scope assumption: [profile or "provisional"]
- Preliminary estimate: [lower]k – [upper]k tokens
- Preliminary confirmation: Yes / Auto-accepted (non-interactive) / No (run stopped)
- Confirmed scope after Phase 1: [profile]
- In-scope phases: [list]
- Refined estimate: [lower]k – [upper]k tokens
- Refined confirmation: Yes / Auto-accepted (non-interactive) / No (run stopped after Phase 1)
- Actual spend: [update at Phase 6]
```

>
> **Pass the Technology Profile from `legacy_analysis.md` Section 10** so the target-architecture agent can skip layers, diagrams, tech choices, and ADRs that are not applicable to this repository's scope.

**Produce**:
- `ai-driven-development/docs/target_architecture/target_architecture.md`
- `ai-driven-development/docs/target_architecture/target_architecture.html`

> Only execute the sub-phases confirmed in the Scope Selection step.
> Phase 4a must complete before 4c/4d/4e/4i (they depend on wireframes); 4a can run in parallel with 4b; 4b/4c/4d/4e/4i can run in parallel with each other as scope allows; 4f/4g/4h can overlap once their prerequisites are met. Phase 4i is mutually exclusive with 4d/4e for the same delivery target.

## Quick Start Prompt
When invoking this agent, use:

> "I want to start a full legacy modernization for [project name]. The legacy system is located at [path]. Use the `legacy-modernization-orchestrator` agent to begin Phase 1."

The orchestrator will:
1. Load this agent
2. Check `redesign_progress.md` for current phase (if resuming)
3. Execute Phases 1–3 in sequence
4. **Pause at Scope Selection** — present the auto-detected targets for confirmation, or ask directly if Phase 1 did not resolve scope
5. Execute only in-scope Phase 4 agents (in parallel where possible)
6. Run Phase 5 comparison after all in-scope dev phases complete
7. Validate Phase 6 final readiness checklist

---

## Resuming In-Progress Projects
If `redesign_progress.md` exists, check the last completed phase and continue from the next phase. Never re-run completed phases unless explicitly requested.
