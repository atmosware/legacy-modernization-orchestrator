# Backend Development Standards

> **Tier 2 — Skill-local standards.** Extends [Core Standards (Tier 1)](../../standards/core.md). Core standards apply universally; this file adds language-agnostic backend architecture rules. Language-specific STANDARDS.md files (e.g., `java-springboot/`, `dotnet-aspnetcore/`, `python-fastapi/`, `go-gin-fiber/`) extend this file further.

These are the **non-negotiable, language-agnostic** standards for all backend implementations.
The SKILL.md procedure references these. Do not deviate — create an ADR if a justified exception is needed.

> **Java 21 + Spring Boot**: For Java-specific standards (Maven folder structure, Lombok, Spring annotations, Docker image template), see [`../java-springboot/STANDARDS.md`](../java-springboot/STANDARDS.md).

## Architecture Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- **Clean Architecture layers**: `Controller → Service → Repository → Entity` — strict, no skipping
- **Dependency Inversion**: Use interfaces, inject via constructor, never field injection
- **No business logic** in controllers, entities, or repositories
- **No raw SQL** — use the ORM or named/parameterized queries only
- **No framework-specific annotations in the `domain/` layer** — domain must be framework-free
- **Authorization at the method/handler level** — never inline role checks in business logic
- **No hard-coded secrets** — all configuration via environment variables or a secrets manager
- **No `DEBUG_MODE` flags** — one application.yml or application.properties is enough
- **No over-engineering** — YAGNI; implement only what is needed

## Standard Error Response Format

All APIs MUST use the RFC 9457 Problem Details shape defined in [core.md §10](../../standards/core.md#10-standard-error-response-format-rfc-9457). Language-specific implementation details are in each Tier-2 skill's STANDARDS.md.

Summary: `type` · `title` · `status` · `detail` · `instance` · `traceId` (mandatory extension) · optional `errors` map for field-level validation failures.

## Application Configuration Structure

Organize configuration files by environment profile. All sensitive values must come from environment variables — no secrets in config files:

- **Common config** — default values shared across all environments
- **Dev profile** — local overrides (local DB, debug logging, relaxed security)
- **Prod profile** — production (all secrets via env vars, structured JSON logging)

Environment variable naming convention: `APP_DATASOURCE_URL`, `APP_SECURITY_JWT_SECRET`

> For the Spring Boot-specific file layout (`application.yml`, `application-dev.yml`, `logback-spring.xml`), see [`../java-springboot/STANDARDS.md`](../java-springboot/STANDARDS.md).

## API Naming & Versioning Conventions

| Convention | Standard |
|---|---|
| Base path | `/api/v1/{resource}` |
| Resources | Plural nouns: `/users`, `/orders`, `/reports` |
| Sub-resources | `/orders/{id}/items` |
| Actions (non-CRUD) | POST to verb: `/orders/{id}/cancel` |
| Query params | `camelCase`: `?pageSize=20&sortBy=createdAt` |
| Response envelope | None for single resource, `{ content, page, totalElements }` for lists |

---

## Logging Standards

Every log entry in production must include:
- `traceId` — OpenTelemetry W3C trace context
- `level`, `timestamp`, `logger`, `message`
- `userId` (where available, from security context)
- Never log: passwords, tokens, PII, full request bodies

> For Java + Spring Boot logging configuration (Logback JSON, MDC fields), see [`../java-springboot/STANDARDS.md`](../java-springboot/STANDARDS.md).
