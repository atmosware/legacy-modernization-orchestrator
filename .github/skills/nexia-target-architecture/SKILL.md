# Target System Design

## Role
**Senior Master Architect** — Design a modern, scalable, maintainable target system grounded in industry standards and justified by analysis of the legacy system.

## When to Use
- After completing `legacy-analysis` and `legacy-architecture` skills
- Need to define the target architecture before development begins
- Require formal architecture decision records (ADR), service boundaries, and API contracts

## Prerequisites (Preflight)
Before starting, verify the following artifacts exist:

| Artifact | Expected Path | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy analysis report | `ai-driven-development/docs/legacy_analysis/legacy_analysis.md` | Always |
| Legacy architecture report | `ai-driven-development/docs/legacy_architecture/legacy_architecture.md` | Always |
| Tech stack selections | `ai-driven-development/docs/tech_stack_selections.md` | Always |

**If any required artifact is missing**: Stop. Report which artifact is missing, which phase produces it (Phase 1: `legacy-analysis`, Phase 2: `legacy-architecture`, Phase 2.5: Tech Stack Selection Gate), and offer: (a) Run the prerequisite phase now, (b) Provide the artifact path manually.

> **Before starting any design work**, read `legacy_analysis.md` **Section 10 — Technology Profile** (to confirm scope) and `tech_stack_selections.md` (to load all confirmed technology choices). Apply every confirmed choice directly — do NOT ask the user again. Skip all design steps, tech choices, diagrams, and ADRs that are not applicable to the confirmed scope. Do NOT design layers that do not exist in the target system.

## Output Location
Create in folder `ai-driven-development/docs/target_architecture/` and produce:
- `target_architecture.md` — Target architecture documentation
- `target_architecture.html` — Interactive visual diagrams (Mermaid.js)

> ⚠️ **Always overwrite these files completely** — never append. Use the active runtime's file-writing mechanism to write the full content from scratch. Appending produces two HTML documents in one file, which breaks rendering.

---

## Tech Stack (apply only layers in scope — language/framework from `tech_stack_selections.md`)

> Read all stack choices from `ai-driven-development/docs/tech_stack_selections.md` — do not hardcode versions here. iOS/Android stacks are fixed (Swift/SwiftUI, Kotlin/Jetpack Compose). TypeScript strict mode applies to all web frontend frameworks. REST + OpenAPI 3.1 applies whenever a backend is in scope.

> Do NOT include rows or sections for tiers that are out of scope.

### Confirmed Tech Choices (read from `tech_stack_selections.md`)

> **Do NOT ask the user for technology preferences** — all flexible choices were collected in Phase 2.5 and saved to `ai-driven-development/docs/tech_stack_selections.md`. Read that file and apply the confirmed selections directly.

| Concern | Confirmed In | Applicable When |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend Language / Framework** | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Backend → Language / Framework | Backend in scope |
| Architecture Style | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Backend → Architecture Style | Backend in scope |
| **Frontend Framework** | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Web Frontend → Framework | Web Frontend in scope |
| State Management (Frontend) | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Web Frontend → Global State Management | Web Frontend in scope |
| UI Component Library | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Web Frontend → UI Component Library | Web Frontend in scope |
| Message Broker | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Backend → Message Broker | Backend in scope |
| Caching | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Backend → Caching | Backend in scope |
| Auth Provider | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Backend → Auth Provider | Backend in scope |
| Database | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Backend → Database | Backend in scope |
| Container Orchestration | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Common → Container/Deployment | Any backend/full-stack |
| CI/CD | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Common → CI/CD | Always |
| Observability | `tech_stack_selections.md` § Common → Observability | Always |

## Procedure

### Step 0.5 — Scope & Complexity Check

> **Run before Steps 1–9.** The number of bounded contexts and in-scope tiers determines whether to proceed linearly or decompose design into parallel sub-tasks.

**Review from prerequisites:**
- Count bounded contexts hinted at in `legacy_analysis.md` (module count, God-tables, integration clusters)
- Count in-scope tiers from `tech_stack_selections.md` (Backend / Web Frontend / Native iOS / Native Android / Cross-Platform Mobile).
  - If `§ Mobile -> Framework` is `Flutter` or `React Native`, count **Cross-Platform Mobile** as one tier.
  - Count `§ iOS` and `§ Android` only when native mobile delivery is actually in scope.
  - Do not double-count mobile by counting both `§ Mobile` and native `§ iOS` / `§ Android` unless the project explicitly includes both a shared cross-platform app and separate native apps.

**Choose a strategy:**

| Scale | Signal | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple** | 1–3 bounded contexts, 1 tier | Proceed through Steps 1–9 sequentially |
| **Moderate** | 4–6 bounded contexts OR 2 tiers | Design contexts one at a time; split backend and each in-scope client/mobile architecture into separate sub-tasks as needed |
| **Complex** | 7+ bounded contexts OR 3+ tiers | One sub-task per bounded context group for Steps 2+3; one sub-task per tier for diagrams |

**Per-context sub-task breakdown (moderate/complex):**

For each bounded context (or group of 2–3 small related ones), create a sub-task that covers:
- Step 2: domain model, ubiquitous language, context relationships
- Step 3: module responsibilities, API surface, owned data, events

Each sub-task writes findings to: `ai-driven-development/docs/target_architecture/_partial_bc_{name}.md`

This agent then:
1. Synthesizes all partial BC files into `target_architecture.md`
2. Runs Steps 4–9 (API design, data architecture, security, diagrams, NFR, ADRs) using all partial inputs

**Multi-tier decomposition:**
- Sub-task A: Backend architecture (Steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ADRs 001–004 + 006)
- Sub-task B: Frontend/Mobile architecture (Step 2 frontend-specific, ADR-005 if any mobile target is in scope, including cross-platform)
- This agent: Diagrams (Step 7) and NFR (Step 8) — synthesized after A and B complete

> Record the decomposition plan (bounded context list + assigned sub-tasks) in `target_architecture.md` before starting any sub-task.

### Step 1 — Architecture Style Decision
Justify the choice between:

- **Modular Monolith** (recommended default): Single deployable, domain modules with hard boundaries, easier ops, easier migration from legacy monolith
- **Microservices**: Only if: independent scaling requirements > 3 services, dedicated teams per service, or proven domain boundaries from DDD analysis
- **Hybrid**: Start modular monolith, extract services incrementally

Document the decision as an **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** using the template from [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md).

### Step 2 — Domain Modeling (DDD)
Apply Domain-Driven Design:

- **Identify Bounded Contexts**: Each context is a potential module/service boundary
- **Define Ubiquitous Language**: Core terms per domain context
- **Map Context Relationships**: Partnership, Shared Kernel, Customer-Supplier, Anticorruption Layer
- **Identify Aggregates**: Root entities with invariants

### Step 3 — Service / Module Design
For each module/service:

| Module | Responsibility | Owns Data? | Exposes API? | Consumes Events? | Publishes Events? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth | User identity, tokens | Yes (users, roles) | Yes | No | user.logged-in |
| [Domain A] | [Responsibility] | Yes/No | Yes/No | [events] | [events] |

### Step 4 — API Design (API-First)
Before any code:
- Define OpenAPI 3.1 spec for all public APIs
- Standardize error model: RFC 9457 Problem Details shape — see `core.md §10` (`type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance`, `traceId`)
- Define versioning strategy: URL path `/v1/` (recommended)
- Define pagination: offset or cursor-based
- Define authentication: Bearer JWT in Authorization header

### Step 5 — Data Architecture
Ground every decision in the DB analysis findings from `legacy_analysis.md` (Section 3):

- **Legacy DB Findings Input**: Review the Table Ownership Matrix, DB anti-patterns, query hotspots, and data quality issues before designing the target data model — these directly inform bounded context boundaries and migration risk
- **Data Ownership**: Each bounded context owns its data (no cross-context DB joins); use the legacy Table Ownership Matrix to propose initial ownership assignments
- **Database per Service/Module**: Separate schemas or databases; resolve legacy God-table coupling by splitting or replicating data with clear ownership
- **Target Data Model**: For each bounded context produce an entity relationship overview (key entities, relationships, constraints); address legacy anti-patterns (overloaded columns → proper typed fields, EAV → structured schema, BLOB serialization → proper columns/JSON)
- **Data Migration Strategy**: Choose per migration scenario — Strangler Fig pattern, DB-level migration scripts (Flyway/Liquibase), dual-write with reconciliation, or big-bang cut-over; document rationale
- **Stored Procedure / Trigger Migration**: For each legacy stored procedure/trigger decide: migrate to application service layer, rewrite as DB function, or deprecate — document decision per item
- **Data Quality Remediation**: Define how legacy data quality issues (nulls, orphaned rows, duplicates) will be cleansed before or during migration — specify scripts, validation gates, and rollback strategy
- **Read Models (CQRS)**: Define where read-optimized projections are needed, especially to replace legacy God-table queries
- **Event Sourcing**: Evaluate if audit trail requirements (previously handled by triggers) justify it

### Step 6 — Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (Keycloak preferred). For LDAP/AD environments, federate via the chosen IdP rather than direct LDAP binding. _(Java/Spring Boot: Spring Security OIDC or Spring Security + LDAP is acceptable as a secondary path.)_
- **Authorization**: RBAC with an externalized permission model. Enforce method-level authorization at every application boundary using the framework's native mechanism. _(Java/Spring Boot: `@PreAuthorize` annotations; .NET: `[Authorize(Policy="...")]`; Python: dependency-injected permission guards; Go: middleware-based policy enforcement.)_
- **Token Strategy**: JWT (short-lived access token, refresh token rotation)
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point, rate limiting, auth validation, request routing
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / Kubernetes Secrets
- **TLS**: HTTPS everywhere, mTLS for service-to-service (if microservices)

### Step 7 — Generate Visual Diagrams (HTML + Mermaid.js)

Use the **HTML + Mermaid.js Page Template** from [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md) as the starting document for `target_architecture.html`.

Required diagram sections — **only include diagrams applicable to the confirmed scope**:

| Diagram | Content | Required When |
|---|---|---|
| **Diagram 1** | High-Level Target Architecture (all clients, gateway, services, DBs, observability) | Always — omit tiers not in scope |
| **Diagram 2** | Bounded Context Map (context relationships per DDD analysis) | Backend in scope |
| **Diagram 3** | Authentication Flow (OAuth2/JWT sequence, full participant chain) | Backend in scope |
| **Diagram 4** | Deployment Architecture (CI/CD pipeline → runtime pods → managed services) | Always |
| **Diagram 5** | Data Architecture / Schema Boundary Map (bounded contexts → owned DB schemas/tables) | Backend in scope |

> **Examples:**
> - `backend-only` repo: include all 5 diagrams; omit any React/mobile client nodes from Diagram 1.
> - `frontend-only` repo: include Diagram 1 (frontend + API boundary), Diagram 4 (deployment); skip Diagrams 2, 3, 5.
> - `mobile-only` repo: include Diagram 1 (mobile clients + API boundary), Diagram 4; skip Diagrams 2, 3, 5.

> **Important**: Replace ALL placeholder service and node labels with actual domain service names from the system design. Remove diagram sections not applicable to the project scope.

### Step 7.1 — Validate the Generated HTML File

After writing `target_architecture.html`, run through the **File Creation Validation Checklist** from [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md) before proceeding.

Key checks for this skill's output:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` appears exactly **once** (no accidental file append)
- All 4 required diagrams are present as `<pre class="mermaid">` blocks (not `<div>`) — 5 if a Data Architecture diagram is applicable
- Multi-line node labels use `<br/>` not `\n` (e.g., bounded context labels)
- Participant display names containing `()`, `/`, or commas are double-quoted
- Every `subgraph` block is closed with `end`
- Node IDs contain no spaces or reserved keywords

If the file is missing or any check fails, **regenerate the entire file** from scratch using the active runtime's file-writing mechanism. Do not attempt to patch individual lines.

### Step 8 — Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
Define measurable targets using the **NFR Table Template** from [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md). Populate actual values agreed with stakeholders.

#### Step 8.1 — SLOs & Error Budgets

For every service exposed to users or dependent services, define an explicit SLO. This table is the go/no-go gate for `final-validation` (Phase 6) and drives Prometheus alert thresholds in `devops-infra` (Phase 4h).

| Service | Availability SLO | Latency SLO (P95) | Error Rate SLO | Error Budget (30-day) | Burn-Rate Alert Threshold | Rollback Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _e.g. Order API_ | _99.9%_ | _< 300 ms_ | _< 0.1%_ | _43.8 min downtime_ | _> 5× in 1 h_ | _Error budget > 10% consumed in 1 h_ |
| _e.g. Auth Service_ | _99.95%_ | _< 150 ms_ | _< 0.05%_ | _21.9 min downtime_ | _> 10× in 30 min_ | _Any P0 alert firing for > 5 min_ |

**Column definitions:**
- **Availability SLO** — agreed uptime target; drives `PodCrashLooping` and health-probe alert thresholds
- **Latency SLO (P95)** — 95th-percentile response time; drives `HighLatencyP95` Prometheus alert
- **Error Rate SLO** — fraction of 5xx responses allowed; drives `HighErrorRate` alert
- **Error Budget (30-day)** — allowable downtime = `(1 − SLO) × 30 × 24 × 60` minutes; surfaced in Phase 6 smoke test plan
- **Burn-Rate Alert Threshold** — multiple of steady-state error rate that triggers a page (fast-burn alert per Google SRE Workbook §5)
- **Rollback Trigger** — condition under which an automated or on-call rollback must be initiated within the post-cutover 72-hour watch window

> **Rule**: Any service with `Availability SLO ≥ 99.9%` **must** have circuit-breaker + retry patterns defined in the architecture (Phase 3 Step 6 — Resilience). Record the SLO table in `target_architecture.md §4`.

### Step 9 — Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
Produce an ADR for each major decision **applicable to the confirmed scope**:

| ADR | Decision | Required When |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Architecture Style selection | Backend in scope |
| ADR-002 | Authentication approach | Backend in scope |
| ADR-003 | Database per service vs shared | Backend in scope |
| ADR-004 | Message broker selection (or none) | Backend in scope |
| ADR-005 | Mobile strategy (native vs cross-platform) | Any mobile target is in scope (iOS, Android, or cross-platform mobile) |
| ADR-006 | Legacy DB migration strategy (strangler fig / dual-write / big-bang) and stored procedure disposition | Backend in scope |

> Skip ADRs for components outside the confirmed scope. If the scope is `frontend-only`, produce only an ADR covering the state management and rendering strategy decisions.

## Next Skill
When target architecture is finalized, proceed based on confirmed scope:

- **If any UI is in scope** (web, iOS, or Android): proceed to [`ui-ux-design`](../ui-ux-design/SKILL.md) for UX design.
- **If backend only**: proceed directly to [`backend-development`](../backend-development/SKILL.md). Skip ui-ux-design.
- **Parallel tracks**: once scope is confirmed, [`backend-development`](../backend-development/SKILL.md) and [`frontend-development`](../frontend-development/SKILL.md) / [`ios-development`](../ios-development/SKILL.md) / [`android-development`](../android-development/SKILL.md) can run in parallel (frontend/mobile require ui-ux-design to complete first).
