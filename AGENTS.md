# Nexia — Agent Instructions

This repository contains a structured multi-agent framework for end-to-end legacy system modernization. All detailed skill instructions live in `.github/skills/`. All agent definitions live in `.github/agents/`.

---

## How to Use This Framework

When a user asks you to modernize, analyse, or redesign a legacy system, you MUST act as the appropriate agent defined below. Read the referenced `SKILL.md` file in full before proceeding — it contains the authoritative, step-by-step instructions, output formats, and Definition of Done checklists. **Do NOT skip, reorder, or summarize steps.**

### Cross-Platform Mobile

> **Native (Swift/Kotlin) is the default and recommended path.** Cross-platform mobile (Phase 4i) is an optional, non-default path supported via the `nexia-cross-platform-mobile` skill (Flutter and React Native only).
>
> | Decision | When | Agent to use |
> |---|---|---|
> | Native iOS | Platform-native behaviour, deep OS integration | `nexia-ios-development` (Phase 4d) |
> | Native Android | Platform-native behaviour, deep OS integration | `nexia-android-development` (Phase 4e) |
> | Flutter | Unified codebase, team knows Dart, confirmed in `tech_stack_selections.md` | `nexia-cross-platform-mobile` (Phase 4i) |
> | React Native | Unified codebase, team knows React/TS, confirmed in `tech_stack_selections.md` | `nexia-cross-platform-mobile` (Phase 4i) |
> | KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) | **Not supported** — KMM is a business-logic sharing layer, not a full UI framework | Use native 4d + 4e with shared domain module |
>
> Do NOT use `nexia-ios-development` or `nexia-android-development` to generate Flutter/React Native code — the output will be incorrect.
> Do NOT use `nexia-cross-platform-mobile` for KMM projects — KMM is out of scope for this framework.

## Execution Rules

1. **Always read the full `SKILL.md` file** for the active agent before starting work.
2. **Never skip or reorder steps** — the skill files are authoritative.
3. **Validate DoD checklists** at the end of each agent's work before proceeding.
4. **Phases 1–3 are always required** — never jump straight to development.
5. **Auto-detect scope from Phase 1** — after `nexia-legacy-analysis` completes, read **Section 10 — Technology Profile** in `legacy_analysis.md` to pre-fill the scope (Backend / Web Frontend / iOS / Android). Present the detected scope to the user for confirmation before Phase 4. Do NOT ask all 4 questions blindly if the profile is already known.
6. **Phase 2.5 (Tech Stack Selection Gate) is mandatory** — collect ALL flexible technology choices from the user after Phase 2 and save them to `ai-driven-development/docs/tech_stack_selections.md`. All downstream agents read from this file. Do NOT ask for tech choices again in Phases 3–4.
7. **Only execute phases relevant to the confirmed scope** — skip and mark N/A any Phase 4 sub-phase whose tier is not present in the repository. Do not design, diagram, or generate code for layers that don't exist.
8. **Phases 4a–4e and 4i can run in parallel** once scope is confirmed and UI/UX contracts are available (4a required before 4c/4d/4e/4i; 4a skipped if backend-only). Phases 4f/4g/4h can run in parallel with each other and with 4b–4e/4i once Phase 3 is complete. **4i is mutually exclusive with 4d/4e for the same mobile target** — do not run both native and cross-platform for the same platform.
9. **Choose dependencies from stable, supported release lines** — prefer LTS or current stable releases, avoid prerelease channels (`beta`, `rc`, `canary`, `preview`, `next`) unless explicitly requested, and never invent exact package versions without verifying them from project files or authoritative release sources available in the runtime.
10. All outputs go into `ai-driven-development/` subdirectories as specified by each skill.
